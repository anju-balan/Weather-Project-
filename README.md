## A.Problem Statement:
To create a website for an IT consultancy company called 'Company INC' located in downtown Toronto. We have to work as a team in an Agile way to deliver the product. The project should be implemented in a continuous integration pipeline with the automated unit test cases, GitHub and Travis CI. The unit-tested end product should be deployed on the server for everyone's access.

## B.Functional requirements:
The website should have the below features, 
•	Current date and time to present in the specific format and refresh every second.
•	By using weather API, the temperature of the Toronto location is displayed in Celcius.
•	Few hyperlinks such as About us, Services, and Customers should be present.
    
## C.Web development with Flask
We have used jQuery as a scripting language to make the current DateTime stamp and developed the time interval to change every second using jQuery (JavaScript Library). With the help of HTML version 5, CSS3, and Bootstrap version 4, we designed the DateTime feature. 
We developed Ontario temperature in Celsius degrees with the help of Open Weather API documentation to create an API key.
